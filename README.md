Once dependencies are installed there is two more steps.

- First, fill the ```/src/config/firebase/FirebaseConfig.tsx``` file with your Firebase project informations. Those are given when creating a project with your firebase dashboard.
- Second, add a ```google-services.json``` at the root of the project which allows authentication with google on android. This authentication method must be allowed in the firebase dashboard.
